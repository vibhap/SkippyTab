This project was a part of the Mobile Application course work that I took during my Master's.  

This is an iOS app that could revolutionize the way we shop at super markets or department stores. It allows the shopper to scan the product barcodes with his/her phone. Eventually, when the user is ready to checkout, the amount is paid electronically.

The customer enters the credit/debit number that avoids the necessity of standing in the lines for their purchase. Just scan and pay with the click of a button and you are good to go!!!!
